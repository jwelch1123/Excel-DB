## FAQ
- Why would you want to use Excel as a database?
  - 
- Is this useful?
  - No
- Why did you make this?
  - My previous manager used the phrase "Excel isn't a Database" so many times I started to wonder if you could.
- Doesn't Pandas provide a DataFrame.to_sql method?
  - Yes, but I found that out after I was almost done. It doesn't do exactly the same thing...
- What would you do differently?
  - Fully read the Pandas and SQLite documentation before starting.
